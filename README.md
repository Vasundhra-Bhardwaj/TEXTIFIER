# TEXTIFIER
Textifier is a mobile application which can extract out the text from a picture which are in different languages (my app can recognize Latin based languages (French, German, English, etc.) in real-time, on device). Texts can be a word a line or a paragraph. Further the text can be edited (cut copy and paste) or manipulated. It can be translated into another language. It can also be searched.

We live in a world which is diverse and vast. In the world 7,111 languages are spoken today .
Can we learn them all? Normal human would say –NO. Even as an active language-lover, you can’t learn all the languages in the world.

I know that many people travel the world and speak only English, or only their native language.
A person who wants to travel world but only know his/her native language would definitely think once again to travel a place
where he/she is not familiar with the language which is being used there.

To help such people who feel bounded / restricted because they couldn’t learn all the languages, who feel traveling and exploring 
different places in the world, would be very difficult and unwelcoming, i have come up with an app which can help people to understand 
sigh boards, menus and anything with a text in different language in their own native language.

THESE ARE SCREENSHOTS OF MY APP:
